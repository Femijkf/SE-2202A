You are given an array of employee objects. Each employee object is structtures as follows:
{
    name: string,
    department: string,
    salary: number,
    yearsOfExperiecnce: number
}

Your task is to implement a function called calculatedAverageSaalry that performs the fooloeoiwing

1 Takes two inputs:
    - An array of employee


Example:
    const employee = [
        {name: 'Alice, department: 'Engineering', salary: 90000, yearsOfExperiecnce: 0},
        {name: 'Alice, department: 'Engineering', salary: 90000, yearsOfExperiecnce: 0},
        {name: 'Alice, department: 'Engineering', salary: 90000, yearsOfExperiecnce: 0},
        {name: 'Alice, department: 'Engineering', salary: 90000, yearsOfExperiecnce: 0}


    ]

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

function calculatedAverageSaalry(employees, department) {
    // Step 1: Filter employees by department and years of experience
    const filteredEmployees = employees.filter(employee =>
        employee.department == department && employee.yearsOfExperiecnce > 5
    );

    // Step 2: Calculate the total salary using reduce
    let totalSalary = filteredEmployees.reduce((sum, employee) => sum + employee.salary, 0);
        //totalSalary = filteredEmployees.reduce(function(sum, employee)) {
            //                              return sum + employee.salary;
       // }, 0;


//Step 3: Calaculate and return the average salary
        if (filteredEmployees.length == 0) {
            retun 0;
        }

        else {
            retun totalSalary / filteredEmployees.length;
        }
}
        const employees = [
            
        ]
