Write a funciton called duplicaetNumbers that fufills the following requirements:

1. Input:
    - An Array of intergers numbers

2. Output:
    - An object where:
        - Each property id an intergetr that appears more than once in the array
        - The value of each property is the count of how many times the integer appears

3. Rules
    - The integers are treated as-is (positive, negative or zero)
    - If no integers are repeated, the function should retun an empty object

Example 1:
    duplicaetNumbers([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5, 3, 3]);

Output:
    {2: 2, 3: 4}
